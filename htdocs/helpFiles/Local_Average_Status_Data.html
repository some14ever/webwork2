<title>Local Status</title>
</head>

<body><br>
<p>
The Status figure is the local average of the Status
individuals at your institution have earned on this problem. The Status is the percentage
correct (from 0% to 100%) recorded for the problem.  A low figure may 
represent a difficult problem.  The Status is often fairly high since 
many students will work on a problem until they get it correct or nearly so.
</p>

<p>
Reviewing a problem and looking at both the average Attempts and 
average Status should give instructors valuable information about
the difficulty of the problem.
